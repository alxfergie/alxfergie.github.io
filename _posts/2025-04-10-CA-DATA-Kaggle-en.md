# ðŸ“Œ Topic Selection and Data Collection Planning
The CA Data Team continued its focus on the Environmental aspect of ESG, specifically Scope 1 carbon emissions. Each member emailed 10 companies to request data, but most were denied due to sensitivity. As a result, the team pivoted to practice data analysis using a Netflix dataset from Kaggle.

## ðŸ“Š Kaggle Data Practice: Netflix Dataset Analysis

âœ… Goal: Each member developed a hypothesis and practiced Excel + Power Query analysis

### Jihee Lee
- Hypothesis: Most Japanese movies fall under horror/thriller/crime genres
- Used pivot table with Japan filtered; analyzed genre frequency

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2025-04-10-CA-DATA-Kaggle/jihee.png)

- Result: Only 21 out of 245 Japanese contents were horror/thriller related
- Conclusion: Hypothesis disproven; Anime Feature was the most common genre
- Visualization confirmed the small proportion of horror genres

### Choi Onhyuk
- Hypothesis: Korea's Netflix content includes more season-based TV shows than single movies
- Used Power Query to filter South Korea â†’ Grouped by content type
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2025-04-10-CA-DATA-Kaggle/onhyuck.png)

- Result: 170 TV Shows vs. 61 Movies â†’ Hypothesis confirmed
- SQL query included for future expansion

```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM netflix_titles WHERE country LIKE '%South Korea%' GROUP BY type;
```

### Chaewon Jung
- Hypothesis: Crime is the most common genre among US TV Shows
- Filtered for TV Show + United States; split genres using delimiter

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2025-04-10-CA-DATA-Kaggle/chaewon.png)
- Result: Kidsâ€™ TV was most common â†’ Hypothesis disproven

### Eunjae Kim
- Hypothesis: In 2020 (COVID era), there were more TV Shows than Movies
- Extracted year from date_added â†’ Created pivot table

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2025-04-10-CA-DATA-Kaggle/eunjae.png)
- Result: In 2020, Movies outnumbered TV Shows 2:1 â†’ Hypothesis disproven
- Trend from 2018â€“2021 showed relative increase in TV Show share during COVID years

### Woojin Shin

- Hypothesis: Specific countries tend to produce content concentrated in specific genres
- Used Power Query + Pivot table to analyze genre distribution by country
- Excel file attached for reference
