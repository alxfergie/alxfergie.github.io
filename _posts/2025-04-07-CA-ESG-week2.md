## ðŸ“Œ MSCI ESG Rating System Clarification

We focused on MSCI due to its strong influence in the global investment community. Initially, we misunderstood the difference between the **Percentile Rating** (e.g., AAA) and the **Issue Score** (used for classifying firms as Leader, Average, or Laggard). Upon review, we corrected this and redesigned our visual model of MSCIâ€™s ESG methodology to reflect the actual evaluation process.

## ðŸ”œ Next Step

Next week, we will apply the corrected MSCI framework to **real company data** and analyze ESG ratings across selected firms.
