## Starting from Zero

I honestly thought no one would join this project. I had just joined Lambda, and there was nothing guaranteed about my ability to take on the role of a leader or anything. On the day of the presentation, I was embarrassed of myself on how poor my presentation was compared to others. However, a team was successfully formed on my first attempt! How many people do you think came in? Just one. There was no disappointment when I was informed about this.

Have you heard the word "quest" a lot? If you haven’t known already, this is a specific term in games indicating the missions that’re given by the NPCs (Non-Player Characters). Quests in games are often easy to understand and applicable, and it’s because we are provided with tutorials. How about quests in real life? You’re randomly born from the world, and your game immediately starts. Of course, you’re not given any tutorials nor noticeable quests either. This project’s objective is to give quests to ourselves, just as it’s like in the game, so that we ‘level up’.

It’s always tempting to just take the strawberry from the top of a cake, but isn’t it more important to know how that cake is made rather than just piggyback riding?

## Taking Whatever Opportunities

I looked up all possible contests that we could participate in:
1. Ha Jong-bok Character Contest
2. IGC Research Showcase
3. Pumba Character Merchandise Design Contest
4. Social Impact Digital Art Competition
5. Daegu Gyeongbuk District Public Design Contest
6. Ansan City Tourism Souvenir Contest

By the first week, we managed to apply for the Ha Jong-bok Character Contest and the IGC Research Showcase. Although we didn’t place in the Ha Jong-bok contest, our application for the IGC Research Showcase was accepted.

Despite we weren’t in place for the Ha Jong-Bok contest, we gained valuable lessons from failure. However, the fact that we didn't win doesn't mean the contest is over for us. We plan to analyze the awarded projects and search for patterns if there are any.

In fact, our project in IGC Research Showcase will be about presenting the lessons, mistakes, processes, ideas, and ways of how we progressively concretized our workflow across various contests. Professor Timothy Adam Fletcher from SUNY is our supervisor for this showcase.
