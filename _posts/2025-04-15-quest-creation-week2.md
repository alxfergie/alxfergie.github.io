## Subtitle: Deadline Stresses 

The IGC Research Showcase and GMU Digital Contents Art Creation Project that our group is aiming to complete are all due by the end of April. A research project poster and a game have to be planned and made in less than a month. This may sound overwhelming, and it is in fact quite unmanageable for us two. However, have you heard of the Yerkes—Dodson Law? This is a psychological theory that there’s an empirical relationship between one’s performance and stress level (arousal). Theoretically, an appropriate amount of stress levels brings the utmost performance on tasks, and we feel like this is where we’re at. Though it does feel like we are just under the manageable stress level, which is what we must be careful of.

## Subtitle: After Work Treat 

After April, we’ll be busy presenting and sharing our projects during May and will possibly take a short break for ourselves. Since final exams will also come up during May, we’ll take time looking back at what we’ve done and prepare a record in a format where it can be shared with others as well. Lastly, we’ll most likely begin another project before LAMBDA’s first semester ends. After hard work, treating is necessary!
