# üíß IGC Research Proposal: Water Challenges in Semiconductor Manufacturing

---

## üè≠ Semiconductor Manufacturing and Water Management  
**The Importance of Interdependence**

- The semiconductor industry is a highly advanced technological sector.
- However, its operation relies heavily on **one essential resource: water**.
- The process requires **large volumes of ultra-purified water**, making **water management** a **critical issue** intertwined with technological development.

---

## üåç Climate Change and Drought  
**The Crisis Facing the Industry**

- **Climate change** and **increased droughts** have intensified water supply challenges.
- Semiconductor manufacturers are struggling to **secure sustainable and reliable water sources**.
- In **South Korea**, key areas like the **Yongin National Industrial Complex** have made efforts to address the issue.
- However, **political conflicts** involving **local governments** and the **agricultural sector** have **complicated solutions**.

## ü§ù Community vs. Corporation  
**Conflicts Between Local Communities and Semiconductor Companies**

- **Conflicts between SK hynix and local communities** illustrate the urgent need to:
  - Address water-related challenges,
  - Balance technological expansion with **social and environmental considerations**.

---

## üåé Global Case Studies  
**Developing Solutions Through Comparative Analysis**

- This research analyzes:
  - **Arizona (USA)**
  - **TSMC (Taiwan)**
  - **Paldang Dam (Korea)**

- Through these case studies, the project seeks to:
  - Understand the **interdependence** between water policy and industry,
  - Propose effective strategies such as:
    - **Diversifying water sources**
    - **Recycling wastewater**
