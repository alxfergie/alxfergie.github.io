## The Aesthetics of Coding

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2025-03-22-code2career-intro/figure1.png)

### What is Coding?
- Giving instructions to a computer using its language and code
- Equivalent to programming
- One of the ways of communicating with machines

### Why is Coding Important?
- It drives endless creativity and possibilities
- Creates various forms of jobs and value in the world
- Entertainment for us humans, Homo Ludens, the playing man
- Highly integrated with everyday life.

Coding is bluntly fair to everyone. Whether you're a beginner or not, it’s always challenging. Sometimes, knowing more doesn’t always mean it’s easier–it could be harder. There’s no end to coding, just like how our lives and careers are. Disregarding how vague their ideas might be at this point, what are students thinking of in this project and what do they try to pursue through coding?

## Us minus Colleagues
Some are seniors, some are freshmen, some are from SUNY, Utah, or George Mason. Except for the fact that we are all commonly colleagues of each other. What do we have left?

## “Taking AR to a New Era!”

`Kim Dong-chan` is the organizer of the C2C project and his life is filled with the eager to create a whole new generation in AR platforms. As a leader of this project, he also strongly encourages his teammates wishing it’ll allow them to believe in themselves. While this journey won’t be easy, the trust in himself that persistency is the key to overcome hardships, it seems positive that one day the world will face the generation to AR platforms.

## The Matter of Abiotic to Biotic

Electricity, metal, and computer. These are not alive. But they save lives and bring hope more than anything else. `Kim Da-jin`, who is interested in life sciences and pharmacology, wants to create something that can predict and prevent the conditions of heart disease patients in advance. Coding is unfamiliar and difficult for her, but to get closer to that goal, she is learning to code.

## Building Bridges for Communication

`Kim Min-seo` is curious about apps and wants to understand the basic languages and structures of apps. Ultimately, he aims to create an API (Application Programming Interface), which is a crucial element for the interaction between apps. They act as a controller or metaphorically as a conductor between different mediums, such as allowing and managing data exchanges. Anyone who aims to create a lead conductor of a system is seen as a desirable conductor itself.

## Doppelgängers in Stock Investing

At some point, everyone has probably imagined creating a clone of themselves to handle tasks. `Kim Beom-jun` is aiming to make that imagination a reality. Instead of constantly worrying about every moment, he wants the convenience of generating profits automatically. This is why he chose the difficult and challenging path of coding. When the stock market opens, the trades won’t be made by him, but by a computer that understands his algorithms.

## My Own Columbus App Journey

Apps are familiar to all of us and are indispensable. However, if you’re asked how to create an app, only a few can answer. To become one of those few, and also driven purely by curiosity for something new, `Seong-bin` is ready to type some codes.

## Math Because I Love Games

`Sia` is not naturally inclined toward science. But paradoxically, she feels compelled to learn coding. The reason is simple: she wants to create games. She is learning the basics with one of the most popular commercial engines, Unity, to first imitate by following instructions, and eventually create a game that can run on its own with no help. Even if her skills were limited to basic arithmetic, she would still end up with a game at the end.

## Before the Marathon

Everyone stands just behind the starting line with different goals in mind. While each person will branch out in various directions, there will always be someone to look back on when help is needed. Wish us luck as we’ll always keep faith in our journey.
