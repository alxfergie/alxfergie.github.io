## Lambda Idea Hackathon: **Lambdathon**

From **18:30 on April 25th to 9:00 on April 26th, 2025**, our club will hold an internal idea hackathon called **Lambdathon**, running through the night without sleep.

Since we will need to form teams with unfamiliar members to complete projects, we decided to create a **digital portfolio system** to enrich the experience.

**Dongchan Kim** and **Sia Shin** designed a system called **Lambd@**, which allows anyone to share their portfolio via a **QR code attached to their lanyard**. This goes beyond a simple introduction and aims to showcase one’s experiences and areas of interest through an engaging interface.
