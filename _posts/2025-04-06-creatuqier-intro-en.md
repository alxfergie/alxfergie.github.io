# 🧠 Creatiquer Week 1 – Differences to Strengths

After our first Creatiquer meeting, we spent time getting to know each other better.  
We believe that having team members from **diverse academic backgrounds** gives us a stronger advantage when preparing for competitions.

Before diving into competition selection and idea generation, we felt it was essential to **build trust among teammates** and understand each member’s **strengths and interests**. This, we believe, will lead to better outcomes.

To facilitate this process, we decided to write down our **areas of interest and strategies for project collaboration** on Notion. We then shared and discussed our thoughts together.  
We believe that each step like this will help strengthen our team even further.

In this first week:
- We briefly introduced ourselves and shared our interests.
- We agreed that each team member would **research competitions** that align with their field of interest.
- We will finalize our choice in **Week 2**.

➡️ Please continue to support and follow us on this journey with **Creatiquer**!

# 🎯 Creatiquer Week 2 – Competition Research: Exploring Opportunities for Our Club

During our second weekly meeting, we took the time to:
- Discuss **common interests** based on our diverse backgrounds.
- Identify **relevant competitions** to participate in.

With members from **Technology Management**, **Mechanical Engineering**, and **Electrical & Electronic Engineering**,  
we explored a variety of interests including **environment, engineering, and risk management**.

Instead of settling on a single topic, we focused on finding **competitions that could integrate all of our fields of interest**.

### Why did we choose this competition?

The theme of this competition is:
> **"Proposing innovative ideas applying digital technology to address sustainability challenges in engineering fields, including carbon emission reduction, climate change, and space development."**

This theme aligns well with:
- The **strengths of our club members**, including Technology Management students studying the intersection of **technology and society**, and Mechanical & Electrical Engineering students with **engineering expertise**.
- While most of us are still in our **first or second year** and may not have extensive knowledge in our respective fields, we see this as a great opportunity to:
  - Deepen our understanding of our majors  
  - Gain insights into **interdisciplinary collaboration**

🚀 This semester’s challenge for **Creatiquer** has officially begun — wish us luck!
